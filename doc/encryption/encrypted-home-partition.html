	<h1>Encrypt Your Linux Home Folder: 2 Ways and 10 Steps</h1>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Updated August 22, 2014.</p><p>

</p><p>Here’s a quick &amp; dirty guide to encrypting your Linux 
system's home and swap partitions. Currently two of the most popular 
ways to do this are with eCryptfs and then dm_crypt using Cryptsetup and
 LUKS. TrueCrypt was another generally trusted choice but has succumbed 
to, well, <a href="http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Bitlocker</a>(!?). TrueCrypt has several forks and there is also <a href="https://www.dyne.org/software/tomb/" target="_blank">Tomb</a>. Tomb can't encrypt full hard drives or partitions but it can be used to create encrypted volumes within an operating system.</p>

<p>eCryptfs, dm_crypt and LUKS have been present in the Linux kernel 
since 2.6. They are packaged in most distros' repositories and are the 
backend to encrypting during manual partition setup through Parted or 
GParted. eCryptfs is filesystem encryption and encrypting with dm_crypt,
 LUKS and Cryptsetup is block-level encryption. What does that mean? 
Let’s compare and contrast the two methods. If you found this page but 
were really looking for full disk encryption, then <a href="https://thesimplecomputer.info/full-disk-encryption-with-ubuntu" target="_blank">see here</a></p>

	<div class="gradient"></div>

	<h2>What is eCryptfs?</h2>
<p>eCryptfs is one of several implementations of filesystem encryption, 
similar to EncFS. It originated in part from IBM in 2009, it’s default 
enabled in Google’s Chrome OS and eCryptfs is what Ubuntu’s desktop 
installer uses when you choose to encrypt your home directory when 
entering your username and password during installation. As Canonical 
developer and eCryptfs package maintainer Dustin Kirkland says in <a href="https://slo-tech.com/clanki/10008en/" target="_blank">this interview</a>, <i>“The real goal of eCryptfs is to protect your data if your computer or hard disk is stolen.”</i></p>

<p>When installing Ubuntu or its derivatives, you check the box to 
encrypt /home and that’s literally all you need to do. 
ecryptfs-setup-private is the configuration script used which gives you 
AES in XTS-plain with a 128 bit key size and SHA256 password hashing. If
 you have a swap area, the installer even encrypts that too with 
dm_crypt.</p>

<p>If your distro of choice doesn't have an option like this, there is 
manual setup which is more tedious but lets you customize the 
configuration. If you want eCryptfs but have already installed your 
distro, there are guides to walk you through migrating to an eCryptfs 
encrypted home. Here are two: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_Encryption_with_eCryptfs#Setup_.28in_detail.29" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/installationubuntu/security/encrypt-your-home-folder" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>

<h3>Benefits of eCryptfs</h3>
	<ul>
<li>With the default script and installer, a PAM module automatically decrypts the filesystem when you log in to your account.</li>
<li>On computers with multiple user accounts, when one user logs in, the other users’ data remains encrypted.</li>
<li>Multiple user accounts can share encrypted files.</li>
<li>Supports authentication with multiple keys (both files and passwords) from multiple sources.</li>
<li>Supports AES-NI.</li>
<li>Encryption happens in the kernel, not in userspace like with EncFS, and does not require FUSE.</li>
<li>Supports AES, Twofish, Blowfish, Triple DES and Cast 5 &amp; 6.</li>
<li>Does not require its own block space or partition.</li>
<li>No need to change anything for your incremental file backups.</li>
<li>Can be used to encrypt the contents of cloud storage accounts, independent of the specific service provider.</li>
<li>So easy to do on a new installation, even total noobs have little excuse not to use it.</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Disadvantages of eCryptfs</h3>
	<ul>
<li>Filesystem encryption leaks information. An attacker can mount /home
 and view the filesystem’s hierarchy and the size, permissions and date 
modified of all encrypted files.</li>
<li>The ecryptfs-setup-private script (and thus, Ubuntu’s installer) 
does not encrypt file names. It can be done, but you must do a manual 
configuration of eCryptfs.</li>
<li>eCryptf is only a single-threaded process so the CPU isn't fully taken advantage of.</li>
<li>Can be tricky to get working with non-standard (NTFS, FAT, ext) filesystems.</li>
<li>Filesystem encryption can not be obscured in a sea of random data like block level encryption can.</li>
<li>Filesystem encryption stores the decryption key within the filesystem itself, though encrypted.</li>
	</ul>

<p>I’d say Dustin Kirkland’s outlook on eCryptfs is quite realistic. I 
don't see why file names are not encrypted from the start, but I find no
 fault in giving people ultra simple data encryption as eCryptfs does, 
even if the threat model is primarily computer thieves, presumably with 
no crypto or forensics knowledge and/or need for such information. 
However, outside that area of general protection, eCryptfs would not be 
appropriate.</p>
<br>
 

	<h2>What is dm_crypt/Cryptsetup/LUKS?</h2>
<p>They’re <a href="https://code.google.com/p/Cryptsetup/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#1._General_Questions" target="_blank">three different things</a>
 which are used for block-level and device encryption in Unix systems. 
dm_crypt is the backend kernel module while LUKS and Cryptsetup are 
controllers to create and manipulate your volumes and key files. The 
combination of the three is often just referred to as 'encrypting with 
LUKS'.</p>

<p>LUKS encryption is built into desktop and alternate installers to 
various degrees. Often LUKS encryption is paired with LVM setup which 
can be unnecessary if you have no use for logical volume management or 
more than 4 primary partitions. The default Cryptsetup settings use LUKS
 and give you AES_256 in XTS-plain64 mode and SHA1 password hashing.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
	<ul>
<li>Block-level encryption does not leak information about your 
filesystem. If you mount a LUKS device when it’s closed, you can only 
see a blob of unintelligible data.</li>
<li>Block-level and device encryption have less of an impact on performance than filesystem encryption.</li>
<li>Supports AES-NI and encryption happens in the kernel.</li>
<li>Supports authentication with up to 8 keys (both files and passwords) from different sources.</li>
<li>Supports many different ciphers, modes and key specifications, including all AES finalists.</li>
<li>Can encrypt the system, home and swap partitions individually.</li>
<li>Compatible with Truecrypt containers.</li>
<li>Also so easy to do on a new installation, there's little reason not to for mobile devices.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
	<ul>
<li>More difficult to manually set up than filesystem encryption.</li>
<li>Default settings (Cryptsetup + LUKS) use SHA1 for key hashing which 
cannot be changed from within the installer, be they desktop or 
alternate. There's consolation in the fact that key generation uses 
PBKDF2 (tens to hundreds of thousands of iterations). Still, it's 
becoming time to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/12/oh-great-new-attack-makes-some-password-cracking-faster-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank">move on</a> to SHA3.</li>
<li>The decryption key or passphrase is needed to fully boot the 
computer. For multiple user accounts, everyone’s data is decrypted on 
login and all users must have the decryption key(s).</li>
<li>dm_crypt is single-threaded.</li>
<li>A LUKS header includes the volume header and all key slots. If a 
header or a key slot becomes damaged, all data on the device will be 
irrecoverable. It is vital that you create backups of your LUKS header 
(and don’t store it on the same encrypted partition).</li>
<li>If you encrypt your whole system in separate partitions (for 
example: /, /home and swap), you will have at least two decryption keys 
to enter on boot and when resuming from hibernation: one for / and one 
for swap. That's not including your user password once you get past the 
encryption, but it does assume that you either automatically decrypt 
home with a key file, or are on a distro using systemd.</li>
	</ul>

<p>The biggest arguments for block level encryption are the performance 
advantage and the lack of any indication of what may be inside the 
encrypted volume. Also, I am of the religion that you should have 
separate root and home partitions on non-server systems. This gives you 
more flexibility with fstab and if your system partition breaks or 
becomes too cluttered, you can reimage it and not worry about loosing 
personal data.</p>
<br>


	<h2>The Main Event</h2>
<p>Alas, here is the point of this page: step-by-step instructions for 
encrypting your /home and swap partitions with dm_crypt, Cryptsetup and 
LUKS&amp;—but in a manner unconfined to Cryptsetup's default settings. 
Included as well are more mundane benefits like intuitive volume naming 
(ex. <i>home</i> instead of <i>sda2_crypt</i>), not to mention that you can do this on existing systems without reinstalling anything or even needing a live session.</p>

<p>The only prerequisite is that since dm_crypt is block or device 
encryption, /, /home and swap must all be separate partitions. If you 
use swap with an encrypted home, the swap partition or file must somehow
 be encrypted too or everything moved into it will be plaintext, easily 
recoverable until those drive sectors are overwritten enough times, 
which could take a very long time to happen.</p>

<p>These directions will give you hibernation as well. If you don't use 
swap or hibernate, ignore where they're mentioned. If you do want a swap
 area but don't use hibernation, skip where a swap partition is 
mentioned in the numbered instructions. You can instead use a swap file 
created after your encrypted /home partition is all set up. For this, 
see the More Swap area at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Last but not least: <span style="color:#ff0000; font-size: 120%; text-align:center;">This
 process will completely destroy all data on the designated drives or 
partitions. Back up your personal and config files before going further.</span></p>
<br>

	<h2>Step 1 - Install Cryptsetup</h2>
<p>First thing to do is make sure you have Cryptsetup on the system. If 
you do need it, install while in your normal user account instead of 
later in the root shell so you're not exposing it to the internet.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install cryptsetup
	</code></pre>
<br>


	<h2 id="noisefill">Step 2 - Prepare Noise Fill</h2>
<p>You ideally want to fill the hard drive with nonsense data so that 
your encrypted block devices are indistinguishable from free space. If 
you're starting with a blank drive, do the whole thing, even if you plan
 to install other operating systems. If you want to preserve other 
systems already installed, then only fill the partitions you plan to 
encrypt.</p>

<p>You have two options to do this. Sourcing /dev/urandom is commonly 
suggested for filling and gives you a background of random data. The 
downside is that it is extremely slow, writing in the area of 10-20 MB 
per second even on platter drives with 4K sectors. That can work out to a
 day or more for the operation to complete on a single drive.</p>

<p>Another point is that random data and encrypted data are not the same
 and in this scenario, sourcing such high quality entropy (well, as 
quality as a default system can get) is very unnecessary. You're not 
generating encryption keys with this, you're only masking where 
encrypted data is on the hard drive.</p>

<p>The second and less common option uses /dev/urandom, /dev/zero and 
OpenSSL to fill with an AES encrypted data stream at your drive's normal
 write speed. This can still take a while for large drives, but is 
naturally a fraction of what's needed for urandom. This method is 
especially appropriate if you choose AES for your encrypted partitions 
because then you're hiding AES ciphertext in, wait for it...AES 
ciphertext!</p>

<p>There are no security implications with one method over the other 
because filler data has no impact on the encrypted partitions' integrity
 or the encrypted data inside. OpenSSL can't do other block ciphers in 
counter mode though, so AES it is, but this isn't a concern because, 
again to drive the point home, you're only writing noise to the storage 
device.</p>

<p>The command below creates a 128 byte encryption key seeded from 
urandom. /dev/zero is used to fill the drive but AES-256 in CTR mode is 
used to encrypt /dev/zero's output with the urandom key before anything 
is written to disk. The result is a device filled with AES ciphertext. 
You'll want a root terminal for this or use <span class="icode">sudo -i</span>.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=128 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null | base64)" -nosalt &lt; /dev/zero &gt; /dev/sd<span class="red">xy</span>
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>If you specifically want to fill with urandom, it's your choice. 
Here's that familiar dd command. If you're worried about urandom 
eventually depleting and then looping its entropy pool, <a href="http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/" target="_blank">don't be</a>.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sd<span style="red">xy</span> bs=4096
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>To fill, you can either attach the drive to an already installed 
system by USB/SATA/etc. and work from there, or boot into a live 
session. For either method, you'll know it's nearly completed when it 
warns 'no space left on device'.</p>
<br>


	<h2>Step 3 - Recovery Mode</h2>
<p>When all is finished with drive filling, boot into recovery mode or if you have the root account enabled, boot into that. <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/92556/how-do-i-boot-into-a-root-shell" target="_blank">Here</a>
 are instructions for how to do it. In recovery mode, notice you only 
have read access to the filesystem. You need write access too so remount
 the system partition.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
mount -o remount,rw /
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>Now you should be here (the "state: read-only" part won't change):</p>

	<img src="encrypted-home-partition_files/remountrw.html" alt="">
<br>
<br>


	<h2>Step 4 - Cryptsetup</h2>
<p>Create the new encrypted partitions. The command below gives you an 
equivalent to the eCryptfs default crypto strength, the only difference 
is that I changed the XTS mode to plain64 from plain which allows for 
volumes greater than 2TB. Notice the key size says 256, this is because 
of how XTS mode works. Half of the key space is for the key itself and 
the other half used by the cipher mode so this results in a 128 bit key.
 If you want a 256 bit key in XTS mode with any cipher, you would set 
the key size to 512. Other cipher modes don't need this exception.</p>

<p>Remember, this is just one of many possible combinations. For the 
minimal threat model of keeping info safe from ordinary theft, it’s a 
solid choice. Since we have /home and swap to encrypt, run the 
luksFormat command on each partition.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
cryptsetup luksFormat --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --key-size 256 --hash sha256 /dev/sd<span class="red">xy</span>
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>Now that you have encrypted home and swap volumes, open and name them home and swap (or whatever you want).</p>
<br>

	<pre><code>
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sd<span class="red">xy</span> home

cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sd<span class="red">xy</span> swap
	</code></pre>
<br>


<p>Make an ext 4 filesystem inside and a swap area.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/home

mkswap /dev/mapper/swap
	</code></pre>
<br>
<br>


	<h2>Step 5 - fstab</h2>
<p>fstab tells the system which partitions to automatically mount on 
boot and with what filsystem attributes. Since we now have totally new 
identifiers for our encrypted partitions, we must update fstab with 
them.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
nano /etc/fstab
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>Replace the UUIDs with /dev/mapper/home and /dev/mapper/swap. When finished, it should look similar to this:</p>

	<img src="encrypted-home-partition_files/fstab.html" alt="">
<br>

<p>Then press <strong>Control+X</strong> to exit nano, <strong>Y</strong> to confirm and <strong>Enter</strong> to save the changes.</p>
<br>
 

	<h2>Step 6 - crypttab</h2>
<p>The crypttab file tells the system which are your encrypted volumes. 
Since we created these volumes after the system was already installed, 
there won't be a crypttab file. We'll need to create it but first we 
need the encrypted partitions' block identifiers because we don't want 
to use device names here like /dev/sda2.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
blkid
	</code></pre>
<br>
<p>The UUIDs you want will say crypto_luks at the end. Put them into crypttab.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
nano /etc/crypttab
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>When finished, your crypttab file should look something like below. 
Change the end of a partition's entry to "luks,discard" if it's on an 
SSD and make sure swap's crypttab entry says "swap" at the end. This 
swap option means the mkswap command is run on each boot after the 
volume is opened so there's no chance of anything in swap surviving a 
reboot. Press <strong>Control+X</strong> to exit nano, <strong>Y</strong> to confirm and then <strong>Enter</strong> to save.</p>

	<img src="encrypted-home-partition_files/crypttab.html" alt="">
<br>
<br>


	<h2>Step 7 - Mark Your Territory</h2>
<p>Mount your new /home.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
mount /dev/mapper/home
	</code></pre>
<br>
<p>If you run <span class="icode">ls /home</span>, you’ll see only 
lost+found inside. You must make a new home folder for your user 
account. Documents, Music, etc. will be magically recreated on its own 
thanks to the package <i>xdg-user-dirs</i>, which desktop installations come with.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
mkdir /home/<span class="red">your_username</span>
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>Finally, take ownership and set file and folder permissions.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
chown -R <span class="red">your_username</span> /home/<span class="red">your_username</span>
	</code></pre>
<br>
	<pre><code>
chmod 750 /home/<span class="red">your_username</span>
	</code></pre>
<br>
<br>
 

	<h2>Step 8 - Fix Hibernation</h2>
<p>We now want to set the resume target for coming out of hibernation. Take a look at:</p><br>

	<pre><code>
nano /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
	</code></pre>
<br>
<p>If you see "RESUME=UUID=<i>somelongdeviceidentifier</i>", that's the 
UUID of your old unencrypted swap device. You don't want that. You want 
to resume from your encrypted swap so change it to:</p><br>

	<pre><code>
RESUME=/dev/mapper/swap
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>Now to finish everything off, generate a new boot filesystem image.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
update-initramfs -u
	</code></pre>
<br>
<br>


	<h2>Step 9 - Verify</h2>
<p>Check the LUKS header to see if everything is okay.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sd<span class="red">xy</span>
	</code></pre>
<br>
<p>Here is what the header contents look like. You can see the cipher, 
hashing with the number of PBKDF2 iterations and the used key slot. 
Looks good.</p>

	<img src="encrypted-home-partition_files/luksdump.html" alt="">
<br>
<br>

	<h2>Step 10 - LUKS Header Backup</h2>
<p>Now back up /home's LUKS header. <span class="red">Do not skip this!</span>
 The command below puts the header image on your Desktop, it will be 
owned by root. Leave it that way and move it to external storage.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
Cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sd<span class="red">xy</span> --header-backup-file /home/<span class="red">your_username</span>/Desktop/FILENAME.img
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>That’s it! Type <i>reboot</i>, press Enter and then have a cookie. 
You deserve it. If all went well, you will be asked for the partitions' 
decryption passwords (you won’t have a cropped screen, that’s because of
 Virtualbox):</p>

<br>

	<div class="gradient"></div>


	<h2>Extra Tips</h2>
<h3>General Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If all did not go well, you’ll have the choice to skip mounting or 
enter manual recovery. If an encrypted volume won't mount on boot, it's 
probably the wrong UUID in crypttab or something wrong in fstab. Just go
 back into recovery mode, check the blkid again and that crypttab and 
fstab are as they should be. Worst case scenario: you must start over 
from Step 3, though this shouldn't happen.</p>

<h3>Hibernation Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>The general rule for hibernation is that if it works on an 
unencrypted system, it will work on an encrypted system too, even though
 the software can be uncooperative at times. Changing the RESUME= line 
as you did in Step 8 should be all that's necessary but if you get stuck
 on this, here are some other guides which may prove useful:</p>

        </ul>

<h3>Upgrading &amp; Changing Distros</h3>
<p>If you want to keep your snazzy new partitions but reinstall to a 
newer release or move to a new distro, here’s what to do. Again, <span class="red">back up your data in case something goes wrong!!</span></p>

	<ol>
<li>You’re in the live session, you’re about to install. Mount and 
decrypt home and swap. When you click Install Now, if asked if you want 
to unmount, choose No.</li>
<li>Two or 3 menus in, you'll have the choice to install the new distro 
along side the old, in place of the old, or Something Else. Choose 
Something Else.</li>
<li>Now at the partitioning table, mark / and swap for installation and 
the filesystem type as ext 4 or whatever your choice. Mark / for 
formatting. Set the /dev/mapper/luks entry to mount as /home but <span class="red">do NOT format!</span>
 Make sure /home is not checked to be formatted, then check again; all 
you need to do is mark the mapper device as /home’s mount point and ext 
4. If you format, it will destroy the encrypted partition and everything
 inside.</li>
<li>With the system installed, go into recovery mode again and mount / as rw like in Step 3 further above.</li>
<li>Open fstab and change /dev/mapper/luks to /dev/mapper/home (or 
whatever you named it to). Don't forget swap. Then make sure crypttab is
 set up properly and reboot.</li>
	</ol>
<br>

	<h2>More Swap</h2>
<p>If you do want a swap area but don't use hibernate you can use a swap
 file. You can do this from in your normal user session and you want the
 file located at /home/swapfile because <u>you want the swap file located on an encrypted partition</u>.
 Without hibernate, you'll be suspending to RAM. That's fine, but know 
that your LUKS key is stored in RAM unencrypted when the computer is 
sleeping.</p>

<p>First make a swap container. N is the size you want in gigabytes and a
 minimum swap size of half your system's RAM is realistically 
sufficient.</p><br>

	<pre><code>
sudo fallocate -l <span class="red">N</span>G /home/swapfile
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>Then make the actual swap filesystem and restrict its permissions to root only.</p><br>
	<pre><code>
sudo mkswap /home/swapfile

sudo chmod 0600 /home/swapfile
	</code></pre>
<br>

<p>Add it to fstab.</p><br>
	<pre><code>
/home/swapfile  none  swap  sw  0 0

<p>And last, switch it on. No reboot necessary.</p><br>
	<pre><code>
sudo swapon /home/swapfile
	</code></pre>
<br>

<h3>A False Move</h3>
<p>Some guides mention adding encryption options to crypttab for swap, 
similar to what's below. The intention is to re-encrypt swap's partition
 on each boot with a key seeded by urandom. However, to quote the 
crypttab manual (<span class="icode">man crypttab</span>), these options are, "<i>... ignored for LUKS devices.</i>" Also see where it says LUKS needs a persistent key. The point is: <u>don't add these options unless you're using plain dm_crypt</u>.</p><br>
	<pre><code>
   <span class="red">No!</span>
swap	UUID=....	<u>/dev/urandom</u>	<u>cipher=aes-xts-plain64:whirlpool</u>
   <span class="red">No!</span>
	</code></pre>
<br>
